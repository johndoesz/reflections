How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By viewing the differences introduced in the new file I managed to spot the typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   It can make me correct previously inexistent bugs a lot faster. 
   It can possibly help me see refactorings. See the code progress... 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    con people tend to procrastinate commits/saves.
    pro enables logical management of commit's saves 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    google docs is document oriented while git is project oriented

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show commit messages number of lines and files changed, git diff will show the actual differences between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Fwith git i can revert to the previous working version so i need not be afraid os risky changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    coding boldly
